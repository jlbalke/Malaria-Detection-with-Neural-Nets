# Malaria Detection

The goal of this project is to detect the presence of a malaria infection in images of red blood cells. 
Convolutional neural networks (CNN's) are used to determine whether each red blood cell image is parasitized or not. 
Overall, the best model performed at 95.6% accuracy, which is excellent. 
There is little room for improvement as the performance started to dip as more computationally expensive models were used. 


## How to Install and Run the Project

1. Download the cell images using this [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hcu2c8tt3zq67vk6hfgqv/cell_images.zip?rlkey=5pupqjzed1jmzihxawbbxi42v&st=sn3395fv&dl=0).
2. Use the Python code to run on your local machine.
